        Public Print is a web-app development (software) project for broadcasting news from around the world in various field. This is in need that today people need more accurate and proper information. It is also used as a source for their knowledge and work. Here we do not only show the breaking news but also historical perspective on any topic, more about a culture, place, people, or time period information. 
   Adding social media to this idea where we will open a new platform for every people where they can post their news from different background. Like other social media like YouTube where any common people become a director, Blogger where common people become writer or poet. So in the same way it will be used for technology, science, history, peopleâ€™s idea and many more. The people from different background have access for having and sharing their information with others.
These are the ideas behind this project. This project is based on SIH PS no- 73 under the M/O Information & Broadcasting.
